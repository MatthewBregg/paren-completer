;;; paren-completer.el --- Complete Delimiters
;;; Version: 1.0
;;; package  --- Summary : A package to automatically, language agnostically, fill in delimiters.
;;; Commentary: 
;; See readme.org



;;;;IDEA!
;; A) If someone does complete all delimiters, then just rescan the whole buffer!
;; B) something like (disable-limiters ...) remvoes the limiters given to it from the delimiter list.
;; C) (add-limiters ...) takes in pairs of delimiters, and adds them to the list. 
;; Can't just use the current hooks, as if someone moves the cursor, it won't work!!!
;;Instead, just go through the whole buffer, it's not as slow as I thought.  Tested on a 128,000 line file, did it within a
;;second or two.... Since a 128000 file is going to be very rare, that should be fine....
